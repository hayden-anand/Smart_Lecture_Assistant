#  Smart Lecture Assistant  
**AI-Powered Accessible Learning Tool for Inclusive Classrooms**

The **Smart Lecture Assistant** is an accessibility-focused application developed during the **Google Hackathon**.  
It is designed to support **visually and hearing-impaired students** by converting lecture content into **structured summaries, smart notes, and interactive explanations** using **Google Gemini AI models**.

This project addresses major learning barriers faced by students with impairments by delivering **clear, digestible, and accessible learning materials in real time**.

##  Problem Statement
Traditional classroom lectures pose significant challenges for students with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments:

- Spoken lectures are difficult to follow without visual cues or sign-language support.  
- Manually taking notes is not feasible for many impaired learners.  
- Long, dense content is overwhelming and hard to summarize.  
- Existing tools are often too complex or not optimized for accessibility.  
- Lack of real-time, AI-driven educational assistance tailored to impaired students.  

These barriers directly affect **comprehension, participation, and academic performance**.

##  Solution
The **Smart Lecture Assistant** provides an **AI-driven, accessible system** that converts lecture content into structured educational material. It automatically:

- Summarizes complex lectures  
- Generates clear, concise notes  
- Extracts key concepts and definitions  
- Answers follow-up questions  
- Presents information in a clean, accessible format  

This tool bridges the **accessibility gap** and helps impaired students **understand and retain information more effectively**.
